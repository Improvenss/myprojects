Privacy Policy

Alexander S Zielenski built the Mousecape app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Alexander S Zielenski at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The entire distributed copy of Mousecape made available by Alexander Zielenski henceforth
    shall be referred to as "the app".

Information Collection and Use

The app does not collect or share any information. If files produced by the app
    with personal information are shared it is because a file was shared by the creator.

The app does not use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Log Data

The app collects no logs.

Service Providers

Mousecape has no third party affiliates.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. Parents and guardians
    should make sure children do not share their "cape" files produced by the app
    with personal information inside for safety.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

Since I have no means of notifying you of updates it is incumbent upon you to visit when you download a new version of Mousecape.

This policy is effective as of 2020-06-13
